# Calculator Application

This is a simple calculator application built using Python and the Tkinter library. The application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for performing basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features

- Clear and user-friendly GUI.
- Supports basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
- "C" button to clear the current input or expression.
- "=" button to evaluate the expression and display the result.
- Handles invalid expressions gracefully by displaying an error message.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system (Python 3.6 or higher is recommended).
2. No additional libraries are required as Tkinter comes pre-installed with Python.

## How to Run

1. Copy the `CalculatorApp` code into a `.py` file, for example, `calculator.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the file.
3. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```

4. The calculator window will appear, and you can start performing calculations.

## Usage

1. Enter numbers and operations using the buttons on the GUI.
2. Press `=` to evaluate the expression.
3. Use the `C` button to clear the current input or expression.

## Code Structure

- **`CalculatorApp`**: The main class that contains the logic for the calculator application.
  - **`__init__`**: Initializes the application window and sets up the layout.
  - **`create_widgets`**: Creates the calculator display and buttons dynamically.
  - **`on_button_click`**: Handles button click events and updates the expression or result.
  - **`update_display`**: Updates the calculator's display with the current expression or result.

## Example

### Input:
```
7 + 3
```

### Output:
```
10
```

### Error Handling:
If an invalid expression is entered (e.g., `7 / 0`), the calculator will display `Error`.
